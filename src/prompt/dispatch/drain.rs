//! Step-boundary inbox drain (ARCH §2.11 *Delivery*).
//!
//! At each step boundary — after the prior step's tool entries commit,
//! before the next model call's context assembles (§2.3 drain ordering) —
//! the executor drains the agent's inbox. [`drain`] first commits any
//! renamed-but-uncommitted stray a prior death left in `messages/` (the
//! file left the inbox in a rename that never reached its commit, so it
//! must land — the inverse of §2.3's "an entry that never committed never
//! happened"), then moves each pending inbox message into
//! `messages/NNN-<sender>.md` and commits it (the delivery commit,
//! [`transcript::deliver_message`]).
//!
//! Arrival order across senders is advisory (mtimes); the committed
//! sequence is the record (§2.11). The drain order is deterministic —
//! `(mtime, filename)` — so the same inbox always yields the same
//! committed sequence and replay agrees with the live run.
