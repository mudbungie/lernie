//! `lernie advance <workspace> <agent>` — the §6 driver verb: one hop
//! of the workflow chain.
//!
//! Every §2.11 launch seam spawns this verb (detached, via the injected
//! launcher), the exec baton hands one hop to the next (§6), and an
//! operator runs the same verb by hand — launch after a crash, launch
//! after a deposit, and hand-run are indistinguishable, which is the
//! §6 collapse of "advance" and "resume". A hop:
//!
//! 1. **takes the lease** — an adopted predecessor fd or a fresh
//!    acquire ([`crate::prompt::inbox::baton`]); losing the acquire is
//!    the clean no-op of Writer/driver totality (§2.11).
//! 2. **delivers** — [`super::driver::deliver`]: rematerialize, stray
//!    recovery, delivery commits (§2.11).
//! 3. **derives warrant from the tree** ([`warrant`]) — no launcher
//!    decides warrant; the driver decides under the lock (§2.11). The
//!    derivation is the wire alternation itself (§2.3): a transcript
//!    tail ending user-side means a model call is due.
//! 4. **runs one step** ([`hop`]) — the same step machinery
//!    [`super::run_exchange`] drives.
//! 5. **hands off** — tools ran → [`AdvanceOutcome::ToolsPending`]
//!    carries the live lease out for the caller to exec the successor
//!    (§6 exec baton, [`cli`]); a terminal event ends the chain through
//!    the §2.11 exit protocol (deposit at the terminal event → release →
//!    epitaph-valued launches, at own agent and at the parent the
//!    deposit revived → return).
//!
//! Config resolution is **lazy** (the `resolve` closure): a no-op hop
//! exits before any config file is read or any `bz --version` guard
//! runs, so the pin-1 recursion terminator costs nothing but the probe.
